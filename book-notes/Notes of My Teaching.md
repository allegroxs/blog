# My Teaching
Jacques Lacan
Translated by David Macey

In the preface, Jacques-Alain Miller introduced this book will brings 3 lectures that haven't been published before.

He also said that sometimes Lacan will use funny expressions even in a way like comics, but I can't feel where it sounds funny(). For eg. 
> We've always known about the unconscious, but in psycho-analysis, the unconscious is an unconcious that thinks hard. Just a minute, just a minute.
It's just very similar to some sentences I heard recently (and would also use) that ignores the logic. In fact that's what I think psychoanalysis should be like.

# 1. The Place, Origin, and End of My Teaching

*Place* means something different from what it means in topology(which have to do with essence and then there is your place in the world. You usually get to that place by pushing and shoving, in short that leaves you with hope.).

The function of Psychoanalyst is not self-evident: when it comes to giving his status, his habits, his reference and even his place in the world, nothing obvious, nothing self-evident.

1953 in France for psychoanalysis a moment of crisis
