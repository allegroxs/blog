# My Teaching
Jacques Lacan
Translated by David Macey

In the preface, Jacques-Alain Miller introduced this book will brings 3 lectures that haven't been published before.

He also said that sometimes Lacan will use funny expressions even in a way like comics, but I can't feel where it sounds funny(). For eg. 
> We've always known about the unconscious, but in psycho-analysis, the unconscious is an unconcious that thinks hard. Just a minute, just a minute.
It's just very similar to some sentences I heard recently (and would also use) that ignores the logic. In fact that's what I think psychoanalysis should be like.

# 1. The Place, Origin, and End of My Teaching

**Place** means something different from what it means in topology(which have to do with essence and then there is your place in the world. You usually get to that place by pushing and shoving, in short that leaves you with hope.).

The function of Psychoanalyst is not self-evident: when it comes to giving his status, his habits, his reference and even his place in the world, nothing obvious, nothing self-evident.

1953 in France for psychoanalysis a moment of crisis

lyrics: story  
rhythm: emotion  
logic: apparatus  

*A hole in truth* is not a crude metaphor... there is an inability to aver  
真理的空穴即在表达的不可能性。人可以从“无法言说”体会到真理的漏洞。它不是一个容器有了缝可能滴下些水，它根本就是一个竹篮。

To avoid ambiguity, you may
- create your own word
- reduce it to algebra/literal elements
  
"Mental autimasm" means unconsciousness, Clerambault.  

人是出生在言语之中，被抛入言语之中，然后通过言语成为人。Language was there before man; man is
- born into language as into the world. Like Heiddger's *dwell*
- born through language

>*Dream* is the nodal points where discourse forms a hole.  

Unconsciousness is structured like a language.

> Truth begins to be establishedonly once language exists.

Organization of science: play. emerges "by itself"

Idiots savants:  
// 人脑的计算无法像计算机一样高效：这是否正好揭示一个事实，即，运算能力并不是意识的基础或本质？  
> A weaker logic is not less interesting than a stronger logic, infact it's much more interesting.  
> (People) refused to raise the question of origins. That was a wise decision. It is wise not to talk too much rubbish, and one always talks rubbish when it comes to origins.


Subject of the utterance: 言语表达中的主体/主语
1. 主要是指那个说“我”的人
2. 但没有“我”的一句话也有主语，有时候说话人并非主语
3. 主语的所在不是它生产话语的范围，而是它*被生产*的范围。
——主体也是，主体位于它被生产的范围之内。


The signifer ≈ the *element* in language.  
The signifer is what represents the subject for another signifer  
Element requires formal and topological admission; it is not where it hangs out of *Table O*

    Table O  
    = The Other  
    = site of speech （不是言语发生的地方，而是言语有了价值的地方）  
    => site of truth （价值开创了真理的维度）  
你并不一定非要问他者，你只需要是一个你能说“Oh please God that ...”的人或者别的什么。而以上过程就会指向一个特殊的真理：**The desire/欲望**

欲望的逻辑是一种不在陈述句（indicative）中的逻辑。  
它不是modal logics。  
但是，the register of desire *must* be at Table O. 
- Table O = repercussion of the articulation of language at the level of the Other
- Desire full stop is always the desire of the Other. 欲望，永远是他者的欲望
  - 感受不到他者→感受不到欲望
  - We are always asking the other what he desires
    - 神经症/Neurotic：主体的欲望是让他者问他
    - 宗教：过度把他者的欲望结合起来，而且而是一个不存在的他者God，像一种强迫性神经症/Obsessional Neurotic

转喻：metonymy  
不透明：opaque  
诚实的：veracious  
人的欲望要从他者处提取，变成“我的欲望”。此时轮到人自己去欲望时，他可以注意到，他被阉割了（crastrated）。

阉割情结Castration complex：
1. Sexual desire: only through *medium of a symbol*, or to say *the loss of an organ*
2. Stories, threats made by parents
3. Women: 女人发明出她们可以要求的阳具，以认为自己是被阉割的（实际上没有）
4. 为什么存在阉割？因为欲望的对象**不能**是an organ we can handle. It cannot be both being and having.


Methematics: the subject is fluid and pure.
- The Other is split between the site of truth and desire of Other
- The Subject: a post-language subject, 主体由一些已经发生的话语生产出来，以成熟水果落下的方式从能指链上落下。这是一条可能很复杂的、至少是很精致的signifying chain，其中有他父母的欲望，有时甚至是“希望他不要出生”。

> The least we can aks might be for psychoanalysts to notice that they are poets.

LSD:迷幻剂？并不会弄乱能指链。  
Believe the murder? Transference reflect something in past. 移情总是反映出一些过去发生的事。

Retro actively
deffered action

分析师的沉默不意味着他们在观察。他们也被卷入了“这个实验”。可以说是Logic的而不是empirical（？）

Big O's little d: desire of the Other

Communism: 让他者的愿望掌握政权，固执地捍卫越来越多的谎言。A desire of/for the Other based on justice in the redistributive sense.
而另一边：基于自由即是基于不公。如果你可以说任何话，那么你说什么都不会有效果。

// 这篇演讲的最后是对于精分师的未来的乐观表态。
