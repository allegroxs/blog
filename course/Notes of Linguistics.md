- Q: Language diversity is a diversity of minds?
I don't think people can fundamentally differ in their ways of thinking just because they use different languages. I've been always agreeing that native languege characteristics will influence people's thinking, though.  
On the other side, I don't think people speaking one native tongue really shared a same meaning of convepts.  
There are untranslatable words between languages, but we can have similar internal experience if we are in the similar situation.
