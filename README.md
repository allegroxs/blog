Im trying to use issues as a blog.

## Code
This part is used for version control... it's too wild for blog, although Issues is already quite wild:)

## Issues
When the first version of article is finished, post it here. Convenient to attach the article with Labels and into projects.

## Projects
Can be used as topics for issues; also suitable to make a task list.

## Wiki
like 1 single blog page(Maybe can be used with index?)
