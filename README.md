Im trying to use issues as a blog.

## Code
Yes we can push the local md files then consider this as a blog... But it's too rough!

## Issues
Post blog articles here, we can apply them with labels and into projects.

## Projects
Can be used as topics for issues; also suitable to do time management.

## Wiki
like 1 single blog page(Maybe can be used with index?)
